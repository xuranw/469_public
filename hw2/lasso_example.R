plot(cvglmnet_res) 
## this is the cross validation plot. on the x-axis are different values of the penalty term (in this
##   case, on the log scale), and the y-axis is the estimated MSE. the red dots denote mean estimated MSE
##   averaged over the 10 folds, and the error bars denote the std. deviation of the estimated MSE
## these plots typically have two long vertical dotted lines. the one corresponding to the
##   the smaller value of lambda represents "lambda.min", the lambda that minimized the cross validation
##   metric (i.e., minimum mean estimated mse). The other one represents "lambda.1se", the lambda
##   that is 1 standard error above lambda.min. Both are typically used in practice. Lambda.1se
##   gives a sparser model than lambda.min, at the cost of (potentially) worse predictive power.

## plotting:
plot(cvglmnet_res) # the y-axis is a different loss now, called binomial deviance (instead of MSE)
plot(cvglmnet_res$glmnet.fit) # similar to before
## get coefficients (one of 3 ways)
coef_vec <- output_coefficients(cvglmnet_res, dat, idx)
coef_vec
## get predictions (one of 3 ways)
